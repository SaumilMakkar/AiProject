Microsoft has announced that it will shut down its video-calling platform, Skype, on May 5 â€” just a few days from now. The company believes it no longer needs both Skype, the video-calling platform that made headlines in the early 2000s, and Teams in its business plans. This move is a part of the company's broader strategy to consolidate its communication platforms and focus on Microsoft Teams.
