AMARAVATI (Andhra Pradesh): IBM and Tata Consultancy Services are partnering to further develop India’s quantum computing industry as part of the State of Andhra Pradesh’s Quantum Valley Tech Park, currently being built in the capital city of Amaravati.

The tech park will be anchored by an IBM Quantum System Two installation, with a 156-qubit Heron quantum processor, the largest quantum computer in India. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is partnering with IBM to support the development of algorithms and applications that will help the Indian industry and academia solve some of the nation’s most challenging problems. The Government of Andhra Pradesh, IBM and TCS hope to accelerate the development of India’s quantum ecosystem through this initiative, according to an official release on Friday.

“Our National Quantum Mission is to make India a global hub in the quantum industry; a true center of innovation and job creation with access to the technology capable of solving some of our country’s and the world’s most pressing and complex challenges,” said N. Chandrababu Naidu, Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. “With IBM, TCS, L&T, and other members, the Quantum Valley Technology Park represents how India’s industry and academia will soon be able to take an important step forward in accelerating the achievement of the mission’s goals.”

“We are excited about our plans with the state of Andhra Pradesh to deploy our latest IBM Quantum System Two at the Quantum Valley Tech Park. Our collaboration with TCS will help attract the country’s thriving ecosystem of developers, scientists, and industry experts to develop algorithms and applications. Combining this with India’s National Quantum Mission we could see an acceleration of the next critical milestone – a successful demonstration of quantum advantage,” said Jay Gambetta, Vice President, IBM Quantum.

Members of the Quantum Valley Tech Park can work with TCS for the opportunity to access IBM’s cloud-based quantum computers, and once completed, the Quantum Valley Tech Park will include access to an IBM Quantum System Two with IBM’s latest 156-qubit Heron processor.

“Hybrid architectures are the key to overcoming intractable computing challenges, with quantum computing serving as a catalyst. TCS’s Hybrid Computing strategy is creating what we believe is a breakthrough software layer that intelligently decomposes programs across current systems — CPUs, GPUs and emerging computing architectures — such as quantum. We’re excited to be partnering with IBM, and the Government of Andhra Pradesh at the Quantum Valley Tech Park and support India’s National Quantum Mission to accelerate the development of quantum algorithms and applications that solve complex intractable problems and drive both economic growth and technological innovation,” said Dr Harrick Vin, Chief Technology Officer, Tata Consultancy Services.

The capabilities of IBM’s quantum computers, Qiskit software, and other resources look to enable India’s growing ecosystem of innovators across academia and industry to discover how quantum computers could be applied toward solutions to complex challenges — such as those goals being pursued by the Government of Andhra Pradesh, via the Quantum Valley Tech Park, in contribution to the country’s National Quantum Mission.

By establishing a vibrant quantum ecosystem encompassing research, access to quantum computers, and industry applications, the Government of Andhra Pradesh intends to create high-end jobs, attract top-tier talent, and draw global investments.

As part of this collaboration, TCS will play a pivotal role in driving India’s applied research and innovation by developing quantum use cases across sectors such as life sciences, materials science, supply chain resilience, energy optimization, cryptography, and sustainable manufacturing. The goal is to unlock applications capable of a quantum advantage in solving practical industry problems that are currently beyond the reach of classical computing. TCS’s role within the Quantum Valley Tech Park will give researchers from TCS, domain experts across Indian industry, and academic institutions alike the opportunity to leverage IBM’s quantum computers and resources, the release said.

Intel India President highlights AI, gaming, and EdTech innovation at WAVES 2025
MUMBAI: Gokul V. Subramaniam, President of Intel India and Vice President of the Client Computing Group, showcased Intel's expanding role in India's content and innovation ecosystem during the Waves Summit 2025 in Mumbai.

Speaking to ANI, Subramaniam emphasized Intel's commitment to powering India's growing media, gaming, and educational sectors through cutting-edge AI and processing technologies.

"Waves is an amazing opportunity, especially for content creators working in audio and video. At the core of all this is data -- and data is what Intel is all about," he said.

"We are working across multiple aspects of computing -- from data centers to AI-enabled personal devices -- to enable content creation at every level, from large media conglomerates to individual YouTubers."

Subramaniam explained how Intel's advanced processors and AI accelerators are helping streamline content workflows.

"For the big players, our data center CPUs and AI accelerators are making content creation faster and more AI-driven. And for individual influencers, our AI PCs enable quick video editing and high-quality content generation."

He also highlighted the transformation of India's gaming landscape.

"India has a significant population of gamers. Many have moved from mobile gaming to high-performance, network-based games on laptops. With Intel's innovations in performance, audio-video capabilities, and affordability, we see huge potential in this space."

One of the most exciting developments Subramaniam revealed was Intel's collaboration with Tejas Networks and Sankhya Labs to bring TV tuner capabilities directly into laptops.

"We've integrated broadcast TV tuner and demodulator technology into laptops, in partnership with Tejas and Sankhya Labs. The antenna is built inside the device, allowing users to receive broadcast content without needing internet access. This has massive potential for educational content delivery -- students can access lessons without paying for data or facing online distractions. With our AI PCs, this content can also be transcribed and translated in real-time."

Subramaniam emphasized that Intel's broader vision is to bring AI everywhere -- from the cloud and network to the edge and personal devices.

"India is not just a massive consumer base -- it's a creative powerhouse. With the right tools and innovation, we believe the country can lead in content creation, gaming, and digital learning."

The Waves Summit 2025 brought together industry leaders, tech innovators, and media professionals to explore collaborations and showcase India's potential as a global media and tech hub.

On Thursday afternoon, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated WAVES (World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit). The four-day summit with tagline "Connecting Creators, Connecting Countries" is poised to position India as a global hub for media, entertainment, and digital innovation by bringing together creators, startups, industry leaders, and policymakers from across the world.

In line with Prime Minister's vision of leveraging creativity, technology, and talent to shape a brighter future, WAVES integrates films, OTT, gaming, comics, digital media, AI, AVGC-XR, broadcasting, and emerging tech, making it a comprehensive showcase of India's media and entertainment prowess. WAVES aims to unlock a USD 50 billion market by 2029, expanding India's footprint in the global entertainment economy.

At WAVES 2025, India also hosts the Global Media Dialogue (GMD) for the first time, with ministerial participation from 25 countries, marking a milestone in the country's engagement with the global media and entertainment landscape.

The Summit also features the WAVES Bazaar, a global e-marketplace with over 6,100 buyers, 5,200 sellers, and 2,100 projects. It aims to connect buyers and sellers locally and globally, ensuring wide-reaching networking and business opportunities.

WAVES 2025 witnesses participation from over 90 countries, with more than 10,000 delegates, 1,000 creators, 300+ companies, and 350+ startups. The summit will feature 42 plenary sessions, 39 breakout sessions, and 32 masterclasses spanning diverse sectors including broadcasting, infotainment, AVGC-XR, films, and digital media.
